Maven is surly at times and reveals that he is upset that he did not get to choose his wife, which is standard for a second-born son. Although Maven often acts immature because he is bitter that Cal gets all the privileges of a first-born prince, Mare identifies with his jealousy because of her own jealousy of Gisa (her talented younger sister), who her mother favors. Maven further impresses Mare by revealing that he is working with the Scarlet Guard and fighting for Red rights, and she begins to trust him.</h4>
